    <h2>Glasgow: The City That Doesn’t Try to Please Everyone</h2>
    <p>Glasgow is Scotland’s largest city and arguably the most underrated in the UK. If Edinburgh is the polished official portrait in a kilt with bagpipes, Glasgow is its younger brother who showed up to the family photo in a leather jacket, with a tattoo and a sly grin.
